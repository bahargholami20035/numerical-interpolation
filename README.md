# Python Interpolation Examples

This repository provides simple Python examples for Lagrange and cubic spline interpolation. It also shows Runge's phenomenon and how to improve results using Chebyshev nodes.

## How to Use

1.  **Make sure you have Python installed.**
2.  **Install these libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install numpy scipy matplotlib
    ```
3.  **Download or clone this repository.**
4.  **Run the Python file:**
    ```bash
    python interpolation_demo.py
    ```
   (or whatever you named the file).  This will show plots of the different interpolations.

## What's Included

*   **`interpolation_demo.py`:** (Or your chosen filename) - The Python code.
*   **Example 1:** Interpolating the `sin(x)` function.
*   **Example 2:** Interpolating some sample data points.
*   **Example 3:** Demonstrating Runge's phenomenon (oscillations with high-degree polynomials).
*   **Example 4:** Using Chebyshev nodes to reduce those oscillations.
